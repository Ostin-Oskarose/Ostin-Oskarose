### Hi there, I'm Oskar!👋

Full stack software developer

### 💬 About Me

- I love computers, working with them and learning more about them.
- I enjoy tinkering, programming and setting up technological things.
- I love music - creating and listening to it 😄 I'm a multi-instrumentalist though I mainly focus on guitar, all other instruments I like to experiment with and try to learn them.
- I also love working on scale miniatures, mainly warhammer 40k but also gundams and many other types of models.
